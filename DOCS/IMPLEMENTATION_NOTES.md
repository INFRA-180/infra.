# Implementation Notes

## 2026-07-12 — PWA cold-start catalogue preparation

- The home PWA prepares the global playlist immediately after application startup, without downloading a complete audio file.
- A Play action reuses `tracksData` when it is already in memory and invalidates any obsolete idle preparation before starting playback.
- The historical 110 ms iPhone readiness guard, the 30-second N+1 prefetch threshold, and Service Worker audio Range handling are unchanged. Complete-file N+1 prefetch remains deferred because starting it during the initial `playing` event competes with the first audio buffer on mobile networks.
